<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objective of this programming assignment is to have you 
review C++ programming using following features:
object-oriented design, dynamic memory allocation, pointer
manipulation, exceptions and nested classes.
 

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p> 
In computer science and discrete mathematics, a <i>graph</i> is not a
plot of <i>y = f(x)</i>. A graph has vertices and edges. Here's a simple
example:

</p><p></p><center>
<img src="./Project 1_ Adjacency Lists, CMSC 341 Spring 2017_files/graph.jpg">
</center><p></p>

<p>
The circles are the vertices and the edges are the lines between the
vertices. (It is common to use the words "node" and "vertex"
interchangeably, but for this project we will also have linked lists
with nodes. So, we will only use "vertex" for graphs and reserve "node"
for linked lists.)
</p>

<p>
In the example above, the set of vertices is {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of
edges is {(3,4), (4,1), (3,0), (0,4), (0,1), (2,1), (4,2)}. It is common
to use the ordered pair notation (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) to represent an
edge, but in an undirected graph, the edges are not ordered. Thus,
(2,1) and (1,2) are the same edge.
</p>

<p>
One common way to store a graph is using an adjacency list data
structure. This data structure is just an array of linked lists. For
example, the graph above can be stored as:
</p>

<p></p><center>
<img src="./Project 1_ Adjacency Lists, CMSC 341 Spring 2017_files/adjacency_list_1.jpg">
</center><p></p>

<p>
Here the first linked list, indexed by 0, has the <i>neighbors</i> of of
vertex 0. The neighbors of a vertex <i>v</i> are the vertices in the
graph that are connected to <i>v</i> by an edge. Vertices 1, 4 and 3 are
the neighbors of vertex 0, so they go in the linked list indexed by 0.
Similarly, vertices 2, 0 and 4 are the neighbors of vertex 1.
</p>

<p>
Note that each edge is represented twice in this data structure. For
example, edge (0,3) appears once as vertex 3 in the linked list for vertex 0
and another time as vertex 0 in the linked list for vertex 3.
</p><p>


</p><hr>
<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
Your assignment is to implement an adjacency list data structure
<tt>Graph</tt> that is defined in the header file 
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj1files/Graph.h"><tt>Graph.h</tt></a>.
The <tt>Graph</tt> class provides two iterators. One iterator 
produces the neighbors for a given vertex. The second iterator
produces each edge of the graph <i>once</i>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, you must implement a test program that fully exercises
your implementation of the <tt>Graph</tt> member functions.
Place this program in the <tt>main()</tt> function in a file named
<tt>Driver.cpp</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of an iterator is to provide programmers a uniform way to
iterate through all items of a data structure using a <tt>for</tt> loop.
For example, using the <tt>Graph</tt> class, we can iterate thru the
neighbors of vertex 4 using:
</p>

<p></p><xmp class="code">   Graph::NbIterator nit ;

   for (nit = G.nbBegin(4); nit != G.nbEnd(4) ; nit++) {
      cout << *nit << " " ;
   }
   cout << endl ;
</xmp><p></p>

<p>
The idea is that <tt>nit</tt> (for <b>n</b>eighbor <b>it</b>erator)
starts at the beginning of the list for vertex 4 and is advanced to the
next neighbor by the <tt>++</tt> operator. The <tt>for</tt> loop
continues as long as we have not reached the end of the list. We check
this by comparing against a special iterator for the end,
<tt>nbEnd(4)</tt>. This requires the <tt>NbIterator</tt> class to
implement the <tt>++</tt>, <tt>!=</tt> and <tt>*</tt> (dereference)
operators.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the <tt>Graph</tt> class allows us to iterate through all
edges of a graph using a <tt>for</tt> loop like:
</p>

<p></p><xmp class="code">   Graph::EgIterator eit ;
   pair<int,int> edge ;

   for (eit = G.egBegin() ; eit != G.egEnd() ; eit++) {
      edge = *eit ;   // get current edge
      cout << "(" << edge.first << ", " << edge.second << ") " ;
   }
   cout << endl ;
</xmp><p></p>

<p>
Note that each edge is printed only once, even though it is represented
twice in the adjacency list data structure.
</p>

<p>
Since a program may use many data structures and each data structure
might provide one or more iterators, it is common to make the iterator
class for a data structure an inner class. Thus, in the code fragments
above, <tt>nit</tt> and <tt>eit</tt> are declared as
<tt>Graph::NbIterator</tt> and
<tt>Graph::EgIterator</tt> objects, not just
<tt>NbIterator</tt> and
<tt>EgIterator</tt> objects.
</p>

<p>
If you have not used nested class declarations before, here's an
example:
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj1files/nested.cpp"><tt>nested.cpp</tt></a>
and 
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj1files/nested.txt">sample output</a>.
(For convenience, the class declarations and implementation are provided
in one file, contrary to course coding standards.)
</p>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>
Here are the specifics of the assignment, including a description for
what each member function must accomplish.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> other than the templated <tt>pair</tt> class, you
must not use any classes from the Standard Template Library or other
sources, including <tt>vector</tt> and <tt>list</tt>. All of the data
structure must be implemented by your own code.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Requirement:</b> your code must compile with the original
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj1files/Graph.h"><tt>Graph.h</tt></a> header file.
You are not allowed to make any changes to this file.
Yes, this prevents you from having useful <tt>helper</tt> functions.
This is a deliberate limitation of this project. You may have to
duplicate some code.
</p> 

<p>
<font color="orange">
<b>Requirement:</b> per <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/coding-standards.shtml">our 
course coding standards</a>, your code must compile with <tt>g++</tt>
on the GL servers without using any compilation flags.
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="orange">
<b>Requirement:</b> a program fragment with a <tt>for</tt> loop that
uses your <tt>NbIterator</tt> must have worst case running time that is
proportional to the number of neighbors of the given vertex. 
</font>
</p>

<p>
<font color="orange">
<b>Requirement:</b> a program fragment with a <tt>for</tt> loop that
uses your <tt>EgIterator</tt> must have worst case running time that is
proportional to the number of vertices in the graph plus the number of
edges in the graph. 
</font>
</p>

<br><hr>
<p>
These are the member functions of the <tt>Graph</tt> class (not
including the member functions of the inner classes).
</p>

<ul>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   Graph(int n) ;
</xmp><p></p>

<p>
This is the constructor for the <tt>Graph</tt> class.
The <tt>Graph</tt> class does not have a default constructor, because
we want the programmer to specify the number of vertices in the graph
using the parameter <tt>n</tt>. If the <tt>n</tt> given is zero or
negative, throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
</p>
<p>
The constructor must dynamically allocate space for the adjacency list
and allow edges to be added using <tt>addEdge()</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   Graph(const Graph& G) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the copy constructor for the <tt>Graph</tt> class. It should make a
complete (deep) copy of the <tt>Graph</tt> object <tt>G</tt> given in the parameter. 
The target of the copy is the host object.
</p>
<p>
You should not call the assignment operator from the copy constructor
(or vice versa). The objective of these two member functions are
sufficiently different that you should implement them separately.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   const Graph& operator= (const Graph& rhs) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the overloaded assignment operator for the <tt>Graph</tt> class.
It is called when the compiler sees an assignment like:
</p>
<xmp>   A = B ;
</xmp>
<p>
where both <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are <tt>Graph</tt> objects. The
object <tt>A</tt> becomes the host object of the function and <tt>B</tt>
is passed to the function as <tt>rhs</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Remember to check for self-assignment and to free all dynamically
allocated data members of the host. You should not use the copy
constructor in the implementation of the assignment operator.
</p>
</li>


<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   ~Graph() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the destructor for the <tt>Graph</tt> class. All dynamically allocated
memory associated with the host object must be deallocated. You should
use <tt>valgrind</tt> on GL to check for memory leaks.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   int size() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This function returns the number of vertices in the graph.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   void addEdge(int u, int v) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This function should add an edge between vertices <tt>u</tt> and
<tt>v</tt>. Note that you have to add <tt>v</tt> to the linked list for
<tt>u</tt> and you have to add <tt>u</tt> to the linked list for
<tt>v</tt>. If the values for <tt>u</tt> and <tt>v</tt> are out of
bounds, throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
</p>
<font color="orange">
<p>Your <tt>addEdge()</tt> function must run in constant time.
</p>
</font>
<font color="orange">
<p>You do not have to worry about duplicate edges being added. In
computer science, graphs with multiple edges between the same pair of
vertices is allowed in some situations. (They are called multi-graphs.) 
The client programmers who use your <tt>Graph</tt> class must check for
duplicate edges if they do not want to have duplicate edges in the
graph.
</p>
</font>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   void dump() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This member function is used for debugging. It should print out
the linked lists in the adjacency lists for every vertex.
See the sample outputs below for the suggested format of
the output of the <tt>dump()</tt> function.  
</p>
<p>
Note: you should <b>NOT</b> use the neighbor iterator in
<tt>dump()</tt>, because <tt>dump()</tt> is supposed to help 
you debug your program when the iterators are not working!
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   EgIterator egBegin() ;
   EgIterator egEnd() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
These two functions call the <tt>EgIterator</tt> constructor to create
iterators that can be used in <tt>for</tt> loops to iterate through
the edges of the graph. (See example above.)
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   NbIterator nbBegin(int v) ;
   NbIterator nbEnd(int v) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
These two functions call the <tt>NbIterator</tt> constructor to create
iterators that can be used in <tt>for</tt> loops to iterate through the
neighbors of vertex <tt>v</tt>. (See example above.)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<hr>

<p>
These are the member functions of the edge iterator class
<tt>EgIterator</tt>:
</p>

<ul>
<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   EgIterator(Graph *Gptr = NULL, bool isEnd = false) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the constructor for the <tt>EgIterator</tt> class. It is a
default constructor, since each parameter has a default value. 
The constructor should allow an <tt>EgIterator</tt> to be declared
without any parameters.
</p>
<p>
If <tt>isEnd</tt> is true, then the constructor should make an end
iterator. This can be represented by having the <tt>m_source</tt> be 
the number of vertices (which is larger than any vertex number) 
and <tt>m_where</tt> be NULL.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the constructor should put the iterator in a "good" state and
have <tt>m_source</tt> and <tt>m_where</tt> indicate the first edge in
the graph. (I.e., can be used for <tt>egBegin</tt>.)
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   bool operator!= (const EgIterator& rhs) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This overloaded operator compares two <tt>EgIterator</tt> objects.
It will only be used to compare an <tt>EgIterator</tt> against the end
iterator and must return <s>true</s> <font color="orange">false</font>
when the end is reached. All other uses are unspecified.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">  void operator++(int dummy) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
The post increment <tt>++</tt> operator should advance the iterator to
the next "viable" edge. The dummy parameter indicates this is a 
post increment operator and not a preincrement operator. The dummy
parameter is not actually used as a parameter.
</p>
<p>
A simple way to make sure that each edge is only
visited once by an <tt>EgIterator</tt> is to consider only those edges
where the source vertex (the index of the array) is smaller than or
equal to the vertex in the linked list. For example, if the iterator is
currently located on the edge (2,4) in red below:
</p>
<p></p><center>
<img src="./Project 1_ Adjacency Lists, CMSC 341 Spring 2017_files/adjacency_list_2.jpg">
</center><p></p>
<p>
then the next viable edge is (3,4) in orange above. This is because we consider (2,1)
and (3,0) not viable. These edges were already visited by the iterator
as (1,2) and (0,3). So, we should skip over them when we see their
alternative representation. Thus the <tt>++</tt> operator should figure
out that <tt>m_source</tt> should become 3 and that <tt>m_where</tt>
should point to the <tt>AdjListNode</tt> for vertex 4 in the linked list
for vertex 3 (the orange node above).
</p>
<p>
The <tt>++</tt> operator should have no effect if applied to an iterator
that is already at the end.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   std::pair<int,int> operator*() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the overloaded dereference operator. It returns a pair of
integers using the <tt>pair</tt> class from the standard library.
The pair returned is the edge that the iterator is currently "visiting".
Throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception if the dereference operator is
applied to an iterator that has reached the end.
See Implementation Notes below for further comments.
</p>

</li></ul>

<br><br>
<hr>
<p>
These are the member functions of the neighbor iterator class
<tt>NbIterator</tt>. They are analogous to the functions for
<tt>EgIterator</tt>.
</p>

<ul>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">  NbIterator(Graph *Gptr = NULL, int v = -1, bool isEnd = false) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This is the constructor and default constructor. The constructor should
allow the creation of an <tt>NbIterator</tt> object without any
parameters given.
</p>
<p>
If <tt>isEnd</tt> is true, then object created should be an end
iterator.
</p>
<p>
The parameter <tt>v</tt> indicates that we want to iterate over the
neighbors of <tt>v</tt>.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   bool operator!= (const NbIterator& rhs) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
As before, the only intended use of the <tt>!=</tt> operator is to
compare an <tt>NbIterator</tt> object against the end iterator.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   void operator++(int dummy) ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
The <tt>++</tt> operator advances the iterator to the next neighbor of
<tt>m_source</tt>. All <i>neighbors</i> are viable, so this <tt>++</tt>
operator should be simpler to implement than the one for
<tt>EgIterator</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>++</tt> operator should have no effect if applied to an iterator
that is already at the end.
</p>


<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   int operator*() ; 
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
This dereference operator should return the neighbor that the iterator is
currently "visiting". Throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception if the
dereference operator is applied to an iterator that has reached the end.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>Test Programs</h2> 

<p>
The following test programs may be used to check the compatibility
of your implementation. These programs do not check the
<i>correctness</i> of your implementation.  Even if your implementation
compiles and runs correctly with these programs, it does not mean your
implementation is error-free.  Grading will be done using programs that
exercise your implementation much more thoroughly.  You must do the
testing yourself --- testing is part of programming.  Conversely, if
your implementation does <i>not</i> compile or does <i>not</i> run
correctly with these test programs, then it is unlikely that it will
compile or run correctly with the grading programs.

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2> 

<ul>
<li> Approach this assignment using incremental development. Implement
the <tt>Graph</tt> constructor, <tt>addEdge()</tt> and <tt>dump()</tt>
functions first. Then write a driver program that creates a graph, adds a few
edges and calls <tt>dump()</tt>. When you have debugged these functions,
implement the <tt>NbIterator</tt> class (it's easier). When you have those
functions fully debugged, then implement the <tt>EgIterator</tt> class.
</li>

<li> The <tt>EgIterator</tt> and <tt>NbIterator</tt> classes do not
need destructors, copy constructors or overloaded assignment operators
because they do not have any dynamically allocated data members. The
compiler supplied destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator
will do the right thing.
</li>

<li> Graphs are allowed to have vertices that do not have any edges.
The <tt>EgIterator</tt> constructor should work correctly even if vertex
0, 1, 2 ... have empty adjacency lists. Similarly, the <tt>++</tt>
operator for the <tt>EgIterator</tt> should be able to handle empty
adjacency lists.
</li>

<li> If you are still confused about what an iterator is supposed to do,
consider this implementation of the dereference operator for
<tt>NbIterator</tt>:
<p></p><xmp>   int Graph::NbIterator::operator*() {
      if (m_where == NULL) {
	 throw out_of_range("NbIterator dereference error.") ;
      }
     
      return m_where->m_vertex ;
   }
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
The main purpose of an iterator is to give a programmer
using the <tt>Graph</tt> class access to the neighbors 
of a vertex. The dereference operator is where the rubber meets the
road. When you dereference the iterator, you get an actual neighbor
vertex. That means the iterator should always be in a state where
dereferencing gives you the current neighbor vertex (unless you have
reached the end). That tells you what
<tt>nbBegin()</tt> and the <tt>++</tt> operator has to do. 
The <tt>nbBegin()</tt> object must put <tt>m_where</tt> over the
first neighbor. The <tt>++</tt> operator must advance the iterator to
the next neighbor.
</p>
<p>
The dereference operator for the <tt>EgIterator</tt> is similar:
</p>
<p></p><xmp>   std::pair<int,int> Graph::EgIterator::operator*() {

      if (m_where == NULL) {
	 throw out_of_range("EgIterator dereference error.") ;
      }

      return std::pair<int,int>(m_source, m_where->m_vertex) ;
   }
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
In order for this dereference operator to work, the <tt>EgIterator</tt>
member functions and operators must set the <tt>m_source</tt> and
<tt>m_where</tt> data members correctly. Look at the example adjacency
list above. Now think about what the data members of the iterators
should hold as you advance through the linked list using the <tt>++</tt>
operator. Think about what happens after <tt>++</tt> is applied to an
iterator visiting the last viable edge in the graph.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The reason that <tt>egBegin()</tt> and <tt>nbBegin()</tt> are members of
<tt>Graph</tt> rather than the iterator classes is that the iterators
have to be told which graph they are working with. Since 
<tt>egBegin()</tt> and <tt>nbBegin()</tt> are members of <tt>Graph</tt>, they
can give their host pointers (the <tt>this</tt> pointer) to the iterator
constructors.
</p>

</li><li>
<p>
The "normal" iterator constructors (not creating the end iterator or the
empty iterator) should create an iterator compatible with
<tt>egBegin()</tt> and <tt>nbBegin()</tt>.
</p>

</li><li>
<p>
There is a certain amount of inefficiency inherent in the <tt>for</tt>
loop idiom:
</p>
<p></p><xmp>   Graph::EgIterator eit ;
   for (eit = G.egBegin() ; eit != G.egEnd() ; eit++) {
      ...
   }
</xmp><p></p>
<p>
because we create an iterator with <tt>egBegin()</tt> just to assign it
to <tt>eit</tt>. Also, we create an end iterator for each iteration
using <tt>egEnd()</tt> just so we can compare it to <tt>eit</tt>.
</p>

</li><li> 
<p>
Test your programs for memory leaks (dynamically allocated memory
that was never released) using valgrind. The valgrind command is
available on GL. Just compile your test program and run:
</p><xmp class="code">   valgrind ./Driver.out
</xmp>
This is assuming that your executable file is named <tt>Driver.out</tt>.
If that run did not leak memory, the output from valgrind will say:
<xmp class="code">   All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
</xmp>
As usual, the fact that a single run of your implementation did not
leak memory does not mean that it will never leak memory.

<h2>What to Submit</h2>

<p>
You must submit the following files to the <tt>proj1</tt> directory.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>Graph.cpp</tt>
</li><li> <tt>Driver.cpp</tt>
</li></ul>
<p>
You do not need to submit <tt>Graph.h</tt> because it should not have
changed. If you do happen to place a copy of <tt>Graph.h</tt> in your
submission directory, it will be replaced by a copy of the original
version.
</p>
<p>
If you followed the instructions in the 
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/submission.shtml">Project Submission</a> 
page to set up your directories, you can submit your code using 
this Unix command command.
</p>
<p></p><xmp class="code">   cp Graph.cpp Driver.cpp ~/cs341proj/proj1/
</xmp>
<p></p>
