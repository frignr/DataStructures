<h1>Project 5: Incremental Rehash</h1>

<h2>Due: Tuesday, May 16, 8:59:59pm</h2>

<hr>
<h2>Addenda</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b>[Thu 5/11/17 14:35]</b> 
  Changed the comments in <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test3.cpp"><tt>test3.cpp</tt></a>
  that indicated the slots where <tt>"heliosphere"</tt>, <tt>"obstructs"</tt> and
  <tt>"peripatetic"</tt> would end up in the new table. (Should be 72,
  73 and 77 instead of 71, 72 and 73.)

  </li><li> <b>[Mon 5/8/17 09:25]</b> 
  <br>
  <b>Question:</b> After incremental
  rehashing has started, when do clusters move from the old table to the
  new table?
  <br>
  <b>Answer:</b> Whenever you "touch" a string in the old table, the cluster it
  belongs to should move to the new table. The idea here is that we want
  to migrate strings from the old table to the new table as much as
  possible without running down the old table looking for them. (We
  do that for the final 3%, but that's unavoidable.) So, if you happen
  to see a string in the old table, you should go ahead and move the
  cluster that it is part of to the new table. We move clusters and not
  individual strings, because moving an individual string from the old
  table would break the linear probe searching (and we do still need to
  search in the old table).
  <br>
  In the example with table size 137 given below, after rehashing has 
  started, suppose someone calls <tt>remove("trolley")</tt>.
  Since <tt>"trolley"</tt> is not in the data structure at all,
  you have to look for <tt>"trolley"</tt> in both the new table and
  the old table. With a table of size 137, <tt>"trolley"</tt> 
  hashes to slot 98. You have to probe slots 98, 99 and 100 of the old
  table to determine that <tt>"trolley"</tt> is, in fact, not in the
  table. Even though the search is unsuccessful, you still did find
  some strings in the old table, so you should move the cluster
  consisting of 
  <tt>"abdominal"</tt>,
  <tt>"abhor"</tt>,
  <tt>"abasement"</tt> and
  <tt>"abhorrent"</tt> 
  in slots 96 through 99 from the old table to the new table.

  </li><li> <b>[Mon 5/8/17 09:25]</b> 
  Common bugs seen so far: forgetting to update the number of items
  after inserting or removing a string, taking modulo of number of
  items instead of table capacity, using the capacity of the wrong
  table, trying to <tt>strdup(DELETED)</tt>, trying to use
  <tt>DELETED</tt> as a string, forgetting to intialize the entries
  of a new table to <tt>NULL</tt>. In other words, run of the mill bugs.
  Let's be careful out there.


  </li><li> <b>[Sun 5/7/17 20:10]</b> Test programs posted.

  </li><li> <b>[Thu 5/4/17 14:00]</b> Correction on the syntax for the 
  DELETED. The class definition in the <tt>.h</tt> file should look like:
  <xmp>
     class HashTable {
       
        static char * const DELETED ;

     } ;
  </xmp>
  This has to be initialized in the <tt>.cpp</tt> file:
  <xmp>
  char * const HashTable::DELETED  = (char *) 1 ;
  </xmp>
  Note the change in the positioning of the keyword <tt>const</tt>.


  </li><li> <b>[Wed 5/3/17 09:15]</b> <tt>const</tt> has been removed from
  the parameters of the copy constructor and assignment operator, 
  since the <tt>HashTable</tt> object in the parameter will
  be asked to finish incremental rehashing. The alternative is
  to make most of the data members mutable, but that is too cumbersome.

  </li><li> <b>[Mon 5/1/17 16:30]</b> We usually prefer not to be too
  specific about implementation details that do not affect the
  performance of a data structure, but in order to prevent a bunch of
  questions and also to make grading easier, let's be really specific
  about the length of a linear probe. Suppose a string <i>x</i>
  hashes to index 67:
  <ul>
     <li> If <i>x</i> is inserted in slot 75, the probe length is 
     9 and this does not trigger a rehash. If <i>x</i> is inserted
     in slot 76, then the probe length is 10 and a rehash would be
     triggered. The current cluster that contains slot 76 should be moved
     to the new hash table immediately.

     </li><li> If <i>x</i> is found in slot 75 by a find operation, 
     the probe length is 9 and we do not rehash. If <i>x</i> is found
     in slot 76, then we do start a rehash.  The current cluster that 
     contains slot 76 should be moved to the new hash table immediately.

     </li><li> The remove operation is the same as the find operation,
     since we have to look for an item before we can remove it.
     The slot marked <tt>DELETED</tt> is still part of the cluster,
     there is no item to insert in the new table, but the deleted
     slot joins the slots before it and the slots after it into
     one cluster. This cluster should be moved immediately after
     the deletion, if a rehash is triggered during the operation.
  </li></ul>
  Let's be similarly specific about checking the load factor. First of
  all, the table size is prime and &gt;100, so must be odd. We at least
  do not have to worry about the &gt;= 50% vs &gt; 50% question.
  We should check the load factor at the beginning of every insert, find and
  remove operation.  For insert, this makes sense because if we are 
  going to rehash due to a load factor exceeding 0.5, then we
  want to start inserting in the new hash table right away.
  For find and remove, checking the load factor first, and triggering
  the rehash if needed also clarifies what you are supposed to do with
  the cluster you find in the operation. If you are already in rehash mode,
  yes, you should move that cluster to the new table. Also, since
  the load factor is being checked before we do the insert and remove,
  we don't take into account of the size change from the insert and
  remove when we check the load factor.

  <p>
  As stated previously, these stipulations do not really affect the
  performance of the data structure. It just makes grading easier. It is
  also just easier to say, "Check the load factor before you do anything
  with insert."


  </p></li><li> <b>[Mon 5/1/17 16:10]</b> Clarified that checking the smallest
  table size we want to consider is 101.
  
  </li><li> <b>[Mon 5/1/17 14:50]</b> Clarified that checking whether the
  old heap has less than 3% of the items should be done at the
  <b>beginning</b> of each insert, find and remove operation. (It doesn't
  really matter, but this avoids a bunch of questions.)

  </li><li> <b>[Mon 5/1/17 13:06]</b> Added warning about negative numbers
  and the modulo operator in Implementation Notes.
</li></ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objective of this programming assignment is to have you 
practice implementing a hash table.
 
<hr>
<h2> Background </h2> 

<p>
Your micro-manager of a boss from Project 4 found you out. Somehow he
figured out that you did not implement <i>real</i> min-max heaps for him.
After some verbal reprimand, somehow you got to keep your job.
For your next assignment, your boss says, "You will implement the data
structure EXACTLY as I specify!"
</p>

<p>
Your next assignment is to implement a hash table for strings. Your boss
says you must use open addressing, linear probing and the division
method. He even gives you the function to compute the hashcode of a string:

</p><p></p><xmp class="code">unsigned int hashCode(const char *str) {

   unsigned int val = 0 ;
   const unsigned int thirtyThree = 33 ;  // magic number from textbook

   int i = 0 ;
   while (str[i] != '\0') {
      val = val * thirtyThree + str[i] ;
      i++ ;
   }
   return val ;
}
</xmp><p></p>
<p></p>

<p>
Really?? Linear probing? Doesn't he know that linear probing is
vulnerable to primary clustering? You decide that you will follow your
boss's instructions, but you will nevertheless add your own
optimizations.
</p>

<p>
When a hash table is "full" or has too many collisions, a last resort is
to <i>rehash</i>. When you rehash, you construct another hash table and
insert every item in the old hash table into the new hash table. The new
hash table might be bigger and could use a different hash function. The
hope is that you were just "unlucky" with collisions and that the new
hash table will not have as many.
</p>

<p>
Rehashing is very expensive in terms of running time since you have to
re-insert every item from the old hash table into the new hash table.
Alternatively, you can rehash <i>incrementally</i> and not move the items
all at once. Incremental rehashing will not lower the overall running
time of rehashing, but it will prevent your program from stalling (think
spinning beach balls) while a hash table is being copied.
During an incremental rehash, there are two hash tables
in the data structure: the old hash table and the new hash table. When
you insert a new string, you insert it in the new hash table. When you 
search for a string, the string may be in either the old hash table or
the new hash table. You have to look in both. Similarly, a remove
operation will have to look in both tables and remove the item from the
appropriate one. During the incremental rehash phase, every operation
(i.e., insert, find and remove) will also move a few items from the old
table to the new table. After a number of operations, most of the items
will have migrated to the new table. The stragglers in the old table
will be moved to the new table and the old table can be discarded.
</p>


<hr>
<h2>Your Assignment</h2>

<p>
Your assignment is to implement a hash table data structure that uses
incremental rehashing as described above. 
</p>

<p>Rehashing is triggered in two ways. First, if the load factor of the
table exceeds 0.5 (i.e., more than half of the hash slots are filled), your data
structure should begin the incremental rehashing. Second, if linear
probing during an insert, find or remove operation encounters more than
10 hash slots, then you should also initiate the incremental rehashing. 
The new hash table should have a size that brings the load factor to
0.25 if all of the elements of the old table were moved to the new table
at once. That is, the size of the new table should be approximately four
times the number of items in the old table when the incremental hashing
is triggered. If incremental rehashing was triggered because by a long
linear probe, the new table might actually be smaller than the old
table. In any case, the new table size must be prime, and the new table
size must be different from the old table size.
<span style="color: orange;">
We will also keep our table sizes between 101 and 199,999 for this
project.
</span>
</p>

<p> 
Instead of moving individual items from the old table to the new table,
you will move clusters.  These are contiguous hash slots that are
occupied by items. Clusters are bad for linear probing because they
lengthen the running time for a search. (We do not know that an item is
not in the hash table until we have reached the end of the cluster.)
Also, large clusters tend to get larger because the probability that a
new item hashes to a slot in a cluster increases with the size of a
cluster. Thus, when incremental rehashing has been triggered, every time
a slot <i>t</i> in the old table is accessed (during insert, find or
remove), we
will rehash the cluster in the old hash table surrounding <i>t</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following is a part of the dump from a hash table with
size 137. The numbers in the parentheses after each word is the 
hash index of the word.  The words in slots 67 through 87 form a cluster.
If we did a search for <tt>"aberdeen"</tt>, which hashes to slot 68, we
won't find the word in the linear probing until we reach slot 80. This
will trigger the incremental rehashing since the linear probing had to
examine more than 10 slots to find <tt>"aberdeen"</tt>. Thus, every item
in the cluster from slot 67 through 87 will be moved to the new table.
Note that there are items in the cluster <i>before</i> slot 68 where
<tt>"aberdeen"</tt> hashed to. Also, in the linear probing scheme, when
an item is deleted, the slot it occupied is marked as deleted rather than emptied
(otherwise linear probing won't work for later searches). So, the
cluster also includes deleted slots, but obviously there is no item to
move to the new table for that slot. Subsequently, if we do search on
<tt>"abbreviation"</tt> then the cluster in slots 89 through 91 will be
moved to the new table.
</p>

<p>
</p><xmp class="code">
H[ 60] = 
H[ 61] = 
H[ 62] = abeam (62)
H[ 63] = 
H[ 64] = 
H[ 65] = 
H[ 66] = 
H[ 67] = abbreviated (67)
H[ 68] = abductors (67)
H[ 69] = abattoir (69)
H[ 70] = aardwolf (70)
H[ 71] = abated (70)
H[ 72] = abatement (71)
H[ 73] = abbeys (71)
H[ 74] = abalone (74)
H[ 75] = abandons (75)
H[ 76] = abdicates (69)
H[ 77] = abased (77)
H[ 78] = DELETED
H[ 79] = abel (76)
H[ 80] = aberdeen (68)
H[ 81] = abhorred (67)
H[ 82] = abbreviates (82)
H[ 83] = abducts (82)
H[ 84] = abducted (84)
H[ 85] = abates (85)
H[ 86] = abet (84)
H[ 87] = abhorrence (78)

H[ 98] = abasement (98)
H[ 99] = abhorrent (96)
H[100] = 
</xmp>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that in the example above, if we have not entered incremental
rehashing and we did a search for <tt>"abel"</tt>, this would not
trigger an incremental rehash because <tt>"abel"</tt> hashes to index 76
and we found it in slot 79. The linear probing looked at only 4 slots.
That is, incremental rehashing is not triggered by the <i>existence</i>
of large clusters — it is triggered when we <i>encounter</i> a
long linear probe sequence.
</p>

<p>
When there is an ongoing rehash, we must also check if the number of
items in the old table has dropped below 3% of the total number of items
in the data structure. If that is the case, then we should wrap up the
rehashing and copy all of the remaining items in the old hash table to
the new hash table. The old hash table can then be discarded and we
will exit from the "rehash mode". This check should be done 
<span style="color:orange;"> at the beginning of every </span>
insert, find and remove operation.
</p>

<p>
Finally, what should we do if during an incremental rehash, the load
factor of the new table exceeds 0.5? or if there is a long linear 
probe in the new table? Then, we throw up our hands and give up on
incremental rehashing. We make a third table that has a table size about
4 times the total number of items in the old and new tables, and move 
all of the items into the third table at once.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p> You must design and implement a C++ class <tt>HashTable</tt> that
uses the incremental rehashing scheme as described above. 
The following are some firm requirements (i.e., necessary for grading):

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> The name of your class must be <tt>HashTable</tt>. 
<p></p></li><li> You must use <tt>HashTable.h</tt> and <tt>HashTable.cpp</tt>
for the filenames (case sensitive) of your header and implementation
files.
<p></p></li><li> You must use the <tt>hashCode()</tt> function given above.
<p></p></li><li> You must use open addressing and linear probing.
<p></p></li><li> You must use the division method where hash index is the value returned
by <tt>hashCode()</tt> modulo the table size.
<p></p></li><li> Your table sizes must be prime numbers.
<p></p></li><li> You may not use STL classes, not even <tt>string</tt>.
<p></p></li><li> You must dynamically allocate arrays of type <tt>char *</tt> to
hold your C strings. I.e., the declaration of your table should be
something like:
<xmp>   char ** H ;
</xmp>
<p></p></li><li> Your program must not leak memory.
</li></ul>

<p>
We will be hashing strings. The strings are given in a global array
<tt>words[]</tt>. None of the member functions in your implementation of
the <tt>HashTable</tt> class should use this global array. The driver
programs should be the only code that uses the <tt>words[]</tt> array.
The global variable <tt>numWords</tt> has the size of the
<tt>words[]</tt> array.

</p><xmp class="code">

</p>

<p>
Note that the items in the <tt>words[]</tt> array are <tt>const char

When you store a string in your hash table
you should make a copy of the given string.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, there is an array of prime numbers between 100 and 200,000
in the <tt>primes.h</tt> file. You should use binary search in the
<tt>primes[]</tt> array to find a prime number for your table size.
If, during rehashing, you have to create a table with more than 199,999
items, then just give up and throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.

<h2>Additional Specifications</h2>
</a>

<p>
Here are some additional specifications for the 
<tt>HashTable</tt> class member functions that you have to implement.  
You will definitely want to add other data members and member functions to the
<tt>HashTable</tt> class, but the prototypes for the member functions
listed here should not be changed.  You may create additional classes
if you prefer, but all class declarations should be placed in
<tt>HashTable.h</tt> and all implementations should be placed in
<tt>HashTable.cpp</tt>.
</p>

<ul>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code">   HashTable(int n=101) ;
</xmp>

<p>
This is the default constructor for the <tt>HashTable</tt> class.
The parameter <tt>n</tt> is the requested size of the hash table.
<span style="color:orange;">
If no size is given or if <tt>n</tt> is less than 101, then use the
prime number 101 for the table size.  (I.e., the minimum table size is
101.)
</span>
If the requested size is a prime number
<span style="color:orange;">greater than 100</span>, 
then you should use that size for the table size. 
If the requested size is not a prime number, 
you should use the next highest prime number from <tt>primes.h</tt>.
If the requested size exceeds 199,999, then just give up and throw an
<tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.
The <tt>HashTable</tt> object created by the constructor should be ready
for insertion, search and deletion without any additional
initialization.
</p>
</li>

<br><hr>
<p></p><li> <xmp class="code"> ~HashTable() ;
</xmp>
<p>
This is the destructor. Make sure you deallocate all memory for this
object. The strings in the hash table must be
deallocated using <tt>free()</tt> since they are C strings (i.e., don't
use <tt>remove</tt> for C strings).
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code"> HashTable (HashTable& other) ;
</xmp>
<p>
This is the copy constructor for the <tt>HashTable</tt> class. If the
<tt>other</tt> hash table is not in incremental rehash, then copying the
hash table is very straightforward. Just make sure you allocate memory
for the new hash table and use <tt>strdup()</tt> to copy the strings.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the <tt>other</tt> hash table has an ongoing
rehash, then it doesn't make sense to make a duplicate of a hash table
that is in the middle of being copied. Instead, force the <tt>other</tt>
table to finish its rehashing and copy over the resulting single table.
</p>
<p>
Do not call the assignment operator from the copy constructor. If you do
not want to have duplicate code, then create a third function that handles
the common parts of the both functions.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code"> const HashTable& operator= (HashTable& rhs) ;
</xmp>
<p>
This is the overloaded assignment operator for the <tt>HashTable</tt>
class. As with the copy constructor, the process is fairly standard if
the <tt>rhs</tt> does not have an ongoing incremental rehash. If there
is an ongoing rehash, then force the <tt>rhs</tt> to finish its
rehashing and copy over the resulting single hash table.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   void insert(const char *str) ;
</xmp>
<p>
This function inserts a copy of the C string <tt>str</tt> into the hash
table. It has no return value. (Note: use <tt>strdup()</tt> to copy C strings.)
</p>
<p>
The <tt>insert()</tt> function should insert in the new table if
there is an ongoing incremental rehash.
</p>
<p>
Calling <tt>insert()</tt> with a string that is already in the hash
table should have no effect. (I.e., do not insert a second copy of the
same value.) Make sure you don't have a copy of a string that you didn't
insert floating around. That's a memory leak.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>insert()</tt> function should trigger incremental rehashing when 
appropriate as described above.
The <tt>insert()</tt> operation should also wrap up the incremental rehashing
if the number of items in the old table drops below 3%.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   bool find(const char *str) ;
</xmp>
<p>
The <tt>find()</tt> function looks for <tt>str</tt> in the hash table.
The function returns <tt>true</tt> if found, <tt>false</tt> otherwise.
The <tt>find()</tt> function look in both the old and the new hash
tables if there is an ongoing incremental rehashing.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>find()</tt> function should trigger incremental rehashing when 
appropriate as described above.
The <tt>find()</tt> operation should also wrap up the incremental rehashing
if the number of items in the old table drops below 3%.
</p>


<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   char * remove(const char *str) ;
</xmp>
<p>
The <tt>remove()</tt> function removes <tt>str</tt> from the hash table
and returns the pointer. If <tt>str</tt> is not in the hash table,
<tt>remove()</tt> returns NULL.
</p>
<p>
It is the responsibility of the code that calls <tt>remove()</tt> to
deallocate the string that is returned. (Again, use <tt>free()</tt>,
not <tt>delete</tt> to deallocate.)
</p>
<p>
When an item is removed, the slot it occupied should be marked as
deleted and not set to <tt>NULL</tt>, which would break linear probing.
<span style="color:orange;">
Use the declaration in your <tt>HashTable</tt> class:
</span>
</p>
<xmp style="color:orange;">   static char * const DELETED ;
</xmp>
<p style="color:orange;">Then in the .cpp file, initialize with:
</p>
<xmp style="color:orange;">    char * const HashTable::DELETED  = (char *) 1 ;
</xmp>
<p>
The constant <tt>DELETED</tt> can then be stored in your hash table slot.
This assumes that memory address 1 is never returned by the memory
manager. (That's a pretty safe assumption.)
</p>

<p>
The <tt>remove()</tt> function should trigger incremental rehashing when 
appropriate as described above.
The <tt>remove()</tt> operation should also wrap up the incremental rehashing
if the number of items in the old table drops below 3%.

   int tableSize(int table=0) ;
   int size(int table=0) ;
   const char * at(int index, int table=0) ;
</xmp>
<p>
These functions are used for grading purposes, so we can examine your hash
table(s). The <tt>isRehashing()</tt> function returns <tt>true</tt> if
there is an ongoing incremental rehash. The <tt>tableSize()</tt>
function returns the size of the hash table. When there is an ongoing
rehash, <tt>tableSize(0)</tt> should return the size of the old table
and <tt>tableSize(1)</tt> should return the size of the new table.
Similarly, <tt>size()</tt> returns the number of items currently in the
table(s).
</p>

<p>
The <tt>at()</tt> function returns a pointer to the string stored at 
the <tt>index</tt> slot of the hash table specified by <tt>table</tt>.
If the <tt>index</tt> is invalid (i.e., less
than 0 or greater than or equal to table size), then
<tt>at()</tt> should throw an <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception (already defined in
<tt>stdexcept</tt>).
The pointer returned by <tt>at()</tt> has type <tt>const char *</tt> to prevent the
string stored in the hash table from being changed. The calling function
can make a copy if desired.
</p>

<br><hr>
<p></p></li><li> <xmp class="code">   void dump() ;
</xmp>
<p>
Dump should print some vital statistics and the contents of the hash
table(s) to <tt>stdout</tt>. You should include the table size and number
of items in the hash table(s). When you print out the string in each
hash slot, include the item's hash index in parentheses (see example
above.)

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2> 
</a>

<ul>
<li> Remember to mod out by the table size when you are working with 
hash table indices.

</li><li> Again, in hash tables, the indices wrap around to 0 at the bottom
of the hash table. You must take this into account when you use linear
probing for insert, find and remove.

</li><li> One more time, the indices wrap. This means clusters can straddle
the end of the hash table. When you move a cluster that is at the
beginning or at the end of the table, you have to check if the cluster
wraps around.  Also, note that <tt>for</tt> loops do not work very well
in this situation, because
<xmp>   for (int index = start ; index <= stop ; index++)
</xmp>
doesn't do the right thing when the cluster wraps around.

</li><li> <span style="color:orange;">If you are thinking of working with
negative indices for your hash table, remember that the modulo operator
in C/C++ does not work mathematically (i.e., correctly): <tt>-2 % 10</tt>
evaluates to -2, not 8. So, the negative indices will not wrap around to
the end of the hash table as you might expect.</span>

</li><li> You are working with C null-terminated strings, not C++ strings.
If you haven't used C strings in a while, please review. For example, 
a C string is just an array of <tt>char</tt>, so the type 
is <tt>char *</tt>. A dynamically allocated array of C strings has
type <tt>char * *</tt> since it is a pointer to an array of pointers to
<tt>char</tt>. Here are
<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~slupoli/notes/C++/StringsINotes.docx">
Mr. Lupoli's notes on C strings</a>.

</li><li>
You must use the <tt>strcmp()</tt> function to make string comparisons.
You cannot use the <tt>==</tt> operator. That will do pointer
comparison, not string comparison. To use <tt>strcmp()</tt>, make sure
you
<xmp class="code">   #include <string.h>
</xmp>
or
<xmp class="code">   #include <cstring>
</xmp>

</li><li> Your hash table should make a copy of the string inserted, and not
just store the pointer. Copies should be made using the <tt>strdup()</tt> 
function. 

</li><li> The <tt>strdup()</tt> function allocates memory using
<tt>malloc()</tt> instead of <tt>new</tt>. To deallocate this memory,
you must use <tt>free()</tt> instead of <tt>delete</tt>. While it is
possible to allocate an array of <tt>char</tt> using <tt>new</tt>
like this:
<xmp class="code">   char *str = new char[15] ;
</xmp>
it would be very confusing for one program to sometimes use
<tt>malloc()</tt> and sometimes use <tt>new</tt> to allocate strings.
So, just stick to using <tt>malloc()</tt> and <tt>free()</tt> to
allocate and deallocate C strings. Having said that, you don't really
need to use <tt>malloc()</tt> at all, if you use <tt>strdup()</tt> to
copy strings, since <tt>strdup()</tt> allocates memory.
Finally, for all other memory allocations not involving C strings, 
just use <tt>new</tt>.

</li><li> Some of the strings that you are working with have type <tt>const char
*</tt>. This means the string being pointed to cannot be changed. (The
string is immutable in Python-speak.) Make sure that you know what this
means. If you assign a <tt>const char *</tt> pointer to a <tt>char
*</tt> pointer, the compiler will give you an error.

</li><li> You should avoid copying strings whenever possible. For example,
when you move a string from the old hash table to the new hash table
during a rehash, you do not need to make a copy of the string. This
means you probably want to have two versions of the <tt>insert()</tt>
function. The standard one makes copies (because that's what your client
is expecting). The internal one that you use for moving should not make
copies. (Yes, one can call the other.)

</li><li> You should periodically run your program under <tt>valgrind</tt>
during development. This is so you can catch memory leaks as soon as
possible. Also, if <tt>valgrind</tt> complains about memory read or
memory write errors, this means <b>you have a bug in your program</b>.
You should not ignore these errors.  You should fix the bug as soon as
possible because memory errors tend to manifest themselves in other
places and are difficult to debug. You want to know if your program has
any memory errors as soon as possible, because it is likely that the bug
is in the last few modifications you have made in your program.

<h2>Test Programs</h2>

The following programs should be compiled using
<xmp>   g++ testX.cpp HashTable.cpp
</xmp>
where <tt>testX.cpp</tt> is one of <tt>test1.cpp</tt>, <tt>test2.cpp</tt>,
<tt>test3.cpp</tt>, <tt>test4.cpp</tt> or <tt>test5.cpp</tt>.
Run these programs under <tt>valgrind</tt> to check for memory leaks and
memory read/write errors.
<ul>  
<p></p><li> Basic test of <tt>insert()</tt>, <tt>find()</tt> and
<tt>remove()</tt> without triggering incremental rehashing.
Code 
(<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test1.cpp"><tt>test1.cpp</tt></a>)
and sample output 
(<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test1.txt"><tt>test1.txt</tt></a>).

<p></p></li><li> Rehashing triggered. Clusters moved from old
hash table to new hash table. Rehashing ends and only
one table remains.
Code 
(<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test2.cpp"><tt>test2.cpp</tt></a>)
and sample output 
(<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test2.txt"><tt>test2.txt</tt></a>).

<p></p></li><li> Rehashing triggered. Further insertions cause
long probe sequence in new table. Rehashing stopped and
all items are consolidated in one hash table.
Code 
(<a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj5files/test3.cpp"><tt>test3.cpp</tt></a>)
and sample output

<p></p></li><li> Robust test with thousands of calls
to <tt>insert()</tt>, <tt>find()</tt> and <tt>remove()</tt>.
Resulting hash table is checked against equivalent STL <tt>set</tt>.
