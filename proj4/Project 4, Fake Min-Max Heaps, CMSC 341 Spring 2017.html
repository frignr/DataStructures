<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objective of this programming assignment is 
to familiarize you with the binary heap data structure 
and for you to gain some experience designing templated
C++ code.
 

<hr>
<h2>Background</h2> 

<p>
The premise of this project is that you've been asked, say by your boss,
to implement a min-max heap. This data structure allows you to insert,
delete the smallest item and delete the largest item all in 
<i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) time. 
From what you have heard about min-max
heaps (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/341/fall13/projects/proj3.shtml">Project 3</a>
from the Fall 2013 CMSC 341), you know that they are difficult to
implement and  are chock-full of weird cases
(q.v., <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/341/fall13/projects/proj3-fourth-case.shtml">
Case 4</a>). Suffice it to say, you really don't want to implement real
min-max heaps.
</p>

<p>
So, you concoct a plan to implement a <i>fake</i> min-max heap. Why not
just store every item in two heaps? a min-heap an a max-heap. Presumably
insertion would still be in <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) time, since you just
insert twice. You could delete the smallest item from the min-heap and
the largest item from the max-heap in <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) time. 
You just have to store everything twice, but memory is cheap, right?
Oh wait, when you delete the smallest item from the min-heap, its
"twin" in the max-heap must also be removed. Since heaps do not support
search, you'd have to link the "twins" somehow so when one is removed
from one of the heaps, the other one can also be removed quickly.
</p>

<p>
Since your boss is only semi-literate in C++, you figure you can probably 
get away with this ruse --- you just can't be too obvious about it.
For example, you can't have two separate classes, one for a min-heap and 
one for a max-heap. Also, having <tt>if</tt> statements that check a flag and then
run the code for a min-heap versus a max-heap would be way too obvious.
Since your boss wants you to make the code templated anyway,
your plan is to make a templated heap class that will be instantiated once
for a min-heap and another time for a max-heap.
</p>



<hr>
<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
<i>Note: Running time is one of the most important considerations in
the implementation of a data structure. Programs that produce the
desired output but exceed the required running times are considered
<i>wrong</i> implementations and will receive substantial deductions
during grading.</i>
</p>

<p>
Your assignment is to design and implement a templated C++
class <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> that supports insert, deleteMin
and deleteMax in <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) time. 
You are given general strategies and some specific requirements, but
most of the class design and implementation is up to you.
</p>

<p>
The general requirements are:
</p><ol>
  <li> <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> must support insert, deleteMin
  and deleteMax in <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) time. 
  The restriction here is that searching for a key
  in a heap takes linear time. So, you can't delete the
  root of one heap and look for its twin in the other heap.
  That will take too long.

  </li><li> You may not use STL container classes. (Strings are OK.)

  </li><li> Your templated min-max heap must work with any class that
  supports assignment and comparison. (See test programs.)

  </li><li> You must have one implementation of a heap class
  that can be used as a min-heap and a max-heap.
  The code must use a function pointer to compare items.
  The behavior of this comparison function is what
  determines whether the heap is a min-heap or a max-heap.
</li></ol>



<hr>
<h2>General Strategies</h2>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li> You will need a wrapper class <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> that has the
functions used by the main program and a separate <tt>Heap</tt> class
that does the "bubbling up" and "trickling down" to maintain a heap.
A <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> object will have two <tt>Heap</tt> objects --- one
for the min-heap and one for the max-heap.

</li><li> Each heap has to "know" that it is part of a min-max heap. It just
doesn't "know" if it is the min-heap or the max-heap.

</li><li> Each item in either the min-heap or the max-heap has to keep track
of its "twin" in the other heap. The easiest way to do this is to store
the index of the twin in the other heap. For example, consider the
following output from the <tt>dump()</tt> function of a small min-max
heap. The line
<xmp>   Heap[2] = (6,5)
</xmp>
means that key value 6 is stored in index 2 of the min-heap. The second
value 5 indicates that key 6 is in index 5 of the max-heap. This
confirmed by the output:
<xmp>   Heap[5] = (6,2)
</xmp>
in the max-heap. That is, the 5th item does indeed hold the key value 6.
It also knows that in the min-heap, key value 6 is stored in index 2.
You can confirm for each item in each heap that the index of the item's 
twin in the other heap is recorded properly. You can also confirm
that the min-heap is heap ordered correctly with the smallest item
in the root and the max-heap is heap ordered correctly with the largest itme
int the root.

<xmp class="code">
... MinMaxHeap::dump() ...

------------Min Heap------------
size = 9, capacity = 25
Heap[1] = (2,6)
Heap[2] = (6,5)
Heap[3] = (5,8)
Heap[4] = (10,3)
Heap[5] = (9,9)
Heap[6] = (7,7)
Heap[7] = (16,1)
Heap[8] = (12,2)
Heap[9] = (11,4)

------------Max Heap------------
size = 9, capacity = 25
Heap[1] = (16,7)
Heap[2] = (12,8)
Heap[3] = (10,4)
Heap[4] = (11,9)
Heap[5] = (6,2)
Heap[6] = (2,1)
Heap[7] = (7,6)
Heap[8] = (5,3)
Heap[9] = (9,5)
--------------------------------
</xmp>
<br>

</li><li>
Every time an item is moved in one of the heaps, 
say in the bubbling up process after insertion, you have to
update the item's twin so the twin "knows" the item's new position.
(I.e., after moving an item, a dump should still be consistent as
described above.)  Look at the rest of the output from first
test program for examples: <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj4files/test1.txt">test1.txt</a>.

</li><li> Each heap needs access to the internals of the other heap. So, in
the <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> constructor you have to create two heaps and then
give each <tt>Heap</tt> a pointer to the other <tt>Heap</tt>.

</li><li> You'll have to make templated stand-alone functions (i.e., not
member functions) that compare two heap items and says which one is
bigger or which one is smaller. You can assume that the type/class used to instantiate the
templates supports the six comparison operators:
&lt;, &lt;=, ==, !=, &gt;= and &gt;. The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> constructor
should give a pointer to one of these comparison functions to the appropriate
<tt>Heap</tt> object. That is what determines if the <tt>Heap</tt> is a
max heap or a min heap.

</li><li> The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class has to coordinate insertion and
deletion between the two heaps. For example, suppose that during
insertion, you insert in the min-heap first and then insert in the max-heap.
When you insert in the min-heap, it does not yet have a twin in the
max-heap. After inserting in the min-heap, the <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt>
insertion function has to know the location of the item in 
the array for the min-heap. This index has to be recorded with
the item's twin in the max-heap. Then, the opposite has to happen: 
the newly inserted item's location in the max-heap must be
recorded with its twin in the min-heap.

<p>
A similar coordination must also take place for deletion.

</p></li><li> Your heaps have to support deleting an item given its index. 
(I.e., you have to be able to delete nodes other than the root.)
The removed item should be replaced by the last item in the heap,
as we've seen when the root is removed.
However, when we fix the heap, we may have to bubble up or trickle
down. (Re-read the last sentence.)


</li></ol>

<hr>
<h2>Specific Requirements</h2>
<ol>

<p>
</p><li>
Your class definitions must be in a single file called
<tt>MinMaxHeap.h</tt> (case sensitive). Client programs
that use the <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class should be able to
do so simply using:
<xmp class="code">   #include "MinMaxHeap.h"
</xmp>
All of the template implementations should be in a file
called <tt>MinMaxHeap.cpp</tt> (case sensitive).


<p>
</p></li><li>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a constructor with the
signature:
<p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   MinMaxHeap<T>::MinMaxHeap(int capacity)  ;
</xmp><p></p>
The constructor must create a <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> object
capable of holding <tt>capacity</tt> items. The object
created by the constructor must be able to accept 
insertion and deletion calls right after the constructor is done.


</li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a 
copy constructor with the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   MinMaxHeap<T>::MinMaxHeap(const MinMaxHeap<T>& other)  ;
</xmp><p></p>
The constructor must create a copy of the <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> object
given in the parameter. The copied object must have its own allocated 
memory.

</li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a 
destructor with the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   MinMaxHeap<T>::~MinMaxHeap()  ;
</xmp><p></p>
The destructor must deallocate any dynamically allocated memory.

</li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have an overloaded
assignment operator with the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   const MinMaxHeap<T>& MinMaxHeap<T>::operator=(const MinMaxHeap<T>& rhs)  ;
</xmp><p></p>
The assignment operator must deallocate memory in the host object and
copy the <tt>rhs</tt> <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> into the host.

</li><li>
<p>
Your compiled code must run without memory leaks.

</p></li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a member function
called <tt>size</tt> that returns the number of items in
the min-max heap. The <tt>size()</tt> function must have
the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   int MinMaxHeap<T>::size() ;
</xmp><p></p>
<p>The <tt>size()</tt> function must run constant
time to receive full credit.

</p></li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a member function
called <tt>insert</tt> that adds the item given in the 
parameter to the min-max heap.
The <tt>insert()</tt> function must have
the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   void MinMaxHeap<T>::insert(const T& data) ;
</xmp><p></p>
If min-max heap cannot hold anymore items (i.e., it has reached
capacity), then <tt>insert()</tt> should throw a <tt>out_of_range</tt>
exception.

<p>The <tt>insert()</tt> function must run in <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i> )
time to receive full credit.

</p></li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a member function
called <tt>deleteMin</tt> that removes the smallest item
in the min-max heap and returns the key value of the deleted
item.
The <tt>deleteMin()</tt> function must have
the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   T MinMaxHeap<T>::deleteMin() ;
</xmp><p></p>
If the heap is empty, the <tt>deleteMin()</tt> function 
should throw a <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.

<p>The <tt>deleteMin()</tt> function must run in <i>O</i>(log <i>n</i> )
time to receive full credit.

</p></li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a member function
called <tt>deleteMax</tt> that removes the largest item
in the min-max heap and returns the key value of the deleted
item.
The <tt>deleteMax()</tt> function must have
the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   T MinMaxHeap<T>::deleteMax() ;
</xmp><p></p>
If the heap is empty, the <tt>deleteMax()</tt> function 
should throw a <tt>out_of_range</tt> exception.

<p>The <tt>deleteMax()</tt> function must run in <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> )
time to receive full credit.

</p></li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have a member function
called <tt>dump</tt> that prints out the contents of
the min-max heap including the positions of each key
in the min-heap and the max-heap along with recorded
position of its "twin". See formatting examples in
the sample output below.
The <tt>dump()</tt> function must have
the signature:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   void MinMaxHeap<T>::dump() ;
</xmp><p></p>

</li><li>
<p>
The <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> class must have two member functions
used for grading called <tt>locateMin</tt> and <tt>locateMax</tt>.
These functions should have the prototype:
</p><p></p><xmp class="code">   template <typename T>
   void MinMaxHeap<T>::locateMin(int pos, T& data, int& index) ;

   template <typename T>
   void MinMaxHeap<T>::locateMax(int pos, T& data, int& index) ;
</xmp><p></p>
The function <tt>locateMin</tt> has two reference parameters for
"return values". The <tt>data</tt> parameter should hold the 
value of the item in position <tt>pos</tt> of the min-heap.
The <tt>index</tt> parameter should hold the location of
the item's "twin" in the other heap.

<p>
The <tt>locateMax</tt> function have the analogous requirements.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
Your code must run without segmentation fault and without memory leaks.
For grading purposes, memory leaks are considered as bad as segmentation
faults. This is because many segmentation faults are cause by poorly
written destructors. A program with an empty destructor might avoid some
segmentation faults but will leak memory horribly. Thus, not
implementing a destructor or not deleting unused memory must incur a
penalty that is equivalent to a segmentation fault.

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2> 

<i>Here we list some recommendations and point out some traps and
pitfalls.</i>

<ul> 

<li>
Review C++ template syntax before starting. Remember that you should 
<p></p><xmp class="code">   #include "MinMaxHeap.cpp" 
</xmp><p></p>
at the bottom of the header file. Also, the .cpp file must also
be guarded with <tt>#ifndef</tt>.

</li><li>
Just start at index 1 for the heaps. The "wasted" storage in
the 0-th index could be useful (hint, hint).

</li><li>
<font color="orange">
Beware of off-by-one errors since the 0-th item of the heap array is not
used. A heap with capacity for 100 items needs 101 entries indexed
0 thru 100.
</font>

</li><li>
After you delete an item from a heap, the "twin" object has an 
invalid index for its twin.

</li><li>
There is a special case for deleting the last item of a heap.
This is because we would usually swap in the last item to replace
the item that is deleted. However, if are deleting the last item, then
we would be swapping into an invalid location.

</li><li>
<font color="orange">
When a <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt> is copied, you must make sure that in the
new <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt>, the new min-heap and the new max-heap 
are referencing each other and not the max-heap and min-heap of 
the original <tt>MinMaxHeap</tt>. The same situation applies for 
assignment.
</font>

</li></ul>


<hr>
<h2>What to Submit</h2>

<p>
You must submit the following files to the <tt>proj4</tt> directory.
