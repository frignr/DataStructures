<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objective of this programming assignment is to have you 
practice using recursion in your programs and to familiarize you with
the binary search tree data structure.
 

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>
In real life, laziness if often disdained. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth_(deadly_sin)">Wikipedia article
on sloth</a>.)
In computer science, however, laziness is sometimes a viable strategy.
Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow? especially if there is
a chance that you won't actually have to do it tomorrow either?
</p>

<p>
In contrast to a AVL trees and Red-Black Trees, where we 
diligently maintain a balance condition to guarantee that 
the tree has <i>O</i>( log <i>n</i>) height,
in a Lazy BST, we don't worry about the balancing until things get
really out of whack.  Insert and delete proceed in the same manner as an
unbalanced binary search tree until we notice that at some node of the
BST, the left subtree is twice as large as the right subtree (or vice
versa).  When this happens we <i>rebalance</i> the subtree of the Lazy
BST rooted at this node.
</p>

<p>
When a subtree of a Lazy BST is rebalanced, we convert the entire
subtree into a sorted array. Then we convert the array back into a perfectly
balanced BST. Rebuilding is easy because the array is sorted. 
We can find the middle element of the array in constant time and make it the 
root of the new subtree. Then, we recursively build the left subtree
and the right subtree using, respectively, the portion of the array that
has keys smaller than the root and the portion of the array that has
keys larger than the root. The result is a binary search tree that is
as balanced as possible. 
(See <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj3-example.shtml">Project&nbsp;3 Examples</a>.)
The rebalance procedure takes <i>O</i>( <i>t</i> ) on a BST
subtree with <i>t</i> elements. However, we don't have to rebalance very
often — 
amortized analysis shows that the insert and delete procedures take
<i>O</i>( log <i>n</i> ) amortized time on a Lazy BST with <i>n</i>
elements.
</p>

<p>
Since rebalancing is expensive, we add another provision: we won't
rebalance a subtree that has height &#8804; 3. An unbalanced subtree that
has height 3 will not add very much to the height of the overall tree
and hence will not contribute very much to the running time of the BST
procedures. (We adopt the convention that the
height of a leaf to is&nbsp;0, where a leaf is a node that has actual
data and no children.) 
By ignoring small unbalanced subtrees, we
can avoid excessive rebalancing.  </p>

<p>
<a name="rebalance_note"> One note about the rebalance procedure:</a> 
it is possible for a Lazy BST to
have two nodes <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> where rebalancing is needed
where <i>x</i> is an ancestor of <i>y</i>. In this situation, we want to do
the rebalancing at <i>x</i> since rebalancing the subtree rooted 
at <i>x</i> will also rebalance the subtree rooted at <i>y</i>. If we
rebalanced at <i>y</i> first, the time spent rebalancing at <i>y</i>
is completely wasted since all that work is undone when we rebalance at
<i>x</i>.  (See <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj3-example.shtml#example2">Project&nbsp;3 Examples</a>.)

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
<i>Note: Running time is one of the most important considerations in
the implementation of a data structure. Programs that produce the
desired output but exceed the required running times are considered
<i>wrong</i> implementations and will receive substantial deductions
during grading.</i>
</p>

<p>
Your assignment is to implement a Lazy BST. You may start with a binary
search tree class from the textbook or given by your instructor, if you
prefer.  You may also design your own. Each option has
advantages and disadvantages. 
A primary objective of this programming assignment is to have you use
recursion. So, one component of grading will evaluate how
<i>elegantly</i> you employ recursion to implement this data structure.
(Yes, you are being graded on aesthetics!)
</p>

<p>
Since you will choose the design of the class definitions, no header
files will be distributed with this project. Instead, the requirements
are:
</p><ul>
   <li> The name of the class must be <tt>LazyBST</tt>.
   </li><li> The header file must be named <tt>LazyBST.h</tt> (case
   sensitive).
   </li><li> A client program that includes <tt>LazyBST.h</tt>
   should compile correctly without including any other
   header files.
   </li><li> Your <tt>LazyBST</tt> class must have the member
   functions with the specified signatures indicated below.
   </li><li> The implementation of your member functions and
   any supporting functions must be placed in a single
   file named <tt>LazyBST.cpp</tt>.
   </li><li> No STL classes may be used in this programming project.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p>
In order to implement  <tt>LazyBST</tt> efficiently, your data structure must
be able to determine the size and height of a subtree in constant time.
You must have <b>data members for the height and size of a subtree</b> in the
class representing the root of a subtree of a Lazy BST.  The
<b>height</b> and <b>size</b> data members  must be updated whenever the
height or size of that subtree changes. The update must not affect the
asymptotic running time of insert, delete and search. These must still
run in time proportional to the height of the tree.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>
To keep things simple for this project, we will just store <tt>int</tt>
values in <tt>LazyBST</tt>. Although, well-written code should allow you to
easily change the type of data stored in the data structure.
</p>

<p>
Here are the member functions you must implement in your <tt>LazyBST</tt>
class. (You will need to implement others for your own coding needs.)
</p><ol>

<li>
<p>
A default constructor with the signature
</p><p></p><pre class="code">   LazyBST::LazyBST() ;
</pre><p></p>
The default constructor must create a <tt>LazyBST</tt> object that
is ready to have its member function invoked without any further
processing.

</li><li>
<p>
A copy constructor with the signature
</p><p></p><pre class="code">   LazyBST::LazyBST(const LazyBST&amp; other) ;
</pre><p></p>
The copy constructor must make a deep copy and create a new object that
has its own allocated memory.

</li><li>
<p>
A destructor with the signature
</p><p></p><pre class="code">   LazyBST::~LazyBST() ;
</pre><p></p>
The destructor must completely free all memory allocated for the object.
(Use <tt>valgrind</tt> on GL to check for memory leaks.)


</li><li>
<p>
An overloaded assignment operator with the signature:
</p><p></p><pre class="code">   const LazyBST&amp; LazyBST::operator=(const LazyBST&amp; rhs) ;
</pre><p></p>
The assignment operator must deallocate memory used by the host object
and then make deep copy of <tt>rhs</tt>.


</li><li> 
<p>
An insert() function that adds an item to <tt>LazyBST</tt>
that has the following signature:
</p>
<p></p><pre class="code">   void LazyBST::insert (int key) ;
</pre><p></p>
<p>
The <tt>insert()</tt> function  must run in time proportional to the height
of the Lazy BST 
<font color="orange">(not counting time for rebalancing).</font>
Your <tt>LazyBST</tt> implementation must not allow duplicates. 
If the <tt>insert()</tt> function is invoked with a key value that already
stored in the Lazy BST, your <tt>insert()</tt> function should do
nothing, except that it may rebalance the tree if an imbalance is
detected.
</p>


</li><li> 
<p>
A remove() member function that finds and removes an item with the given key
value.  The <tt>remove()</tt> function should return a boolean value
that indicates whether the key was found.
Your <tt>remove()</tt> function should not abort or throw an exception
when the key is not stored in the BST.
The <tt>remove()</tt> member function must have the following signature:
</p>
<p></p><pre class="code">   bool LazyBST::remove(int key) ;
</pre><p></p>
<p>
For full credit, your <tt>remove()</tt> method must run in time
proportional to the height of the tree
<font color="orange">(not counting time for rebalancing).</font>
</p>


</li><li>
<p>
A <tt>find()</tt> function that reports whether the given 
key is stored in the tree. 
The signature of the <tt>find()</tt> method should be:
</p>
<p></p><pre class="code">   bool LazyBST::find(int key) ;
</pre><p></p>
<p>
For full credit, your <tt>find()</tt> method must run in time
proportional to the height of the tree.
</p>


</li><li>
<p>
A member function <tt>rebalance()</tt> that rebalances a subtree of the
Lazy BST as described above. The running time of <tt>rebalance()</tt>
must be proportional to the number of nodes in the subtree being rebalanced. 
Note that a proper implementation would require you the keep track of 
the size and height of the subtree. Read the description above.
</p>


</li><li> 
<p>
A member function <tt>inorder()</tt> that performs an inorder walk of
the LazyBST and at each node, prints out the key followed by a
<tt>:</tt> followed by the height of the node followed by another
<tt>:</tt> followed by the size of the subtree rooted at that node.
Furthermore, <tt>inorder()</tt> should print an open parenthesis before
visiting the left subtree and a close parenthesis after visiting the
right subtree. Nothing should be printed when <tt>inorder()</tt> is
called on an empty tree, not even parentheses.
This function will be used for grading, so make sure that it works
correctly. The function must have the following signature:
</p>
<p></p><pre class="code">   void LazyBST::inorder() ;
</pre><p></p>
For example, calling <tt>inorder()</tt> on the following BST
should produce the string:
<p></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
(((((3:0:1)7:2:4((9:0:1)11:1:2))14:3:8((15:1:2(17:0:1))20:2:3))22:4:13(((24:0:1)26:1:2)30:2:4(37:0:1)))41:5:22((((50:0:1)54:1:3(59:0:1))60:2:4)64:3:8((71:1:2(75:0:1))79:2:3)))
</blockquote>

</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>
Here, the <tt>41:5:22</tt> indicates that the node with key 41
has height 5 and that there are 22 nodes in the tree.
The output before <tt>41:5:22</tt> is produced by visiting the
left subtree. Everything after <tt>41:5:22</tt> is produced
by visiting the right subtree.
</p>

<p>
</p></li><li>
A function <tt>locate()</tt> that returns whether there is a node in a
position of the LazyBST and stores the key in the reference parameter.
The position is given by a constant C string, where a character
<tt>'L'</tt> indicates left and a character <tt>'R'</tt> indicates
right. The <tt>locate()</tt> function must have the signature
<p></p>
<p></p><pre class="code">   bool LazyBST::locate(const char *position, int&amp; key) ;
</pre><p></p>
For example in the BST above:
<ul>
   <li> A call to <tt>locate("LRL",key)</tt> should return <tt>true</tt>
   and store 26 in <tt>key</tt>.
   </li><li> A call to <tt>locate("RRLR",key)</tt> should return
   <tt>true</tt> and store 75 in <tt>key</tt>.
   </li><li> A call to <tt>locate("RLR",key)</tt> should return 
   <tt>false</tt> and not make any changes to <tt>key</tt>
   since there is not a node in that position. Note: <tt>locate()</tt>
   must not abort and must not throw an exception in this situation.
   </li><li> A call to <tt>locate("",key)</tt> should return <tt>true</tt>
   and store 41 in <tt>key</tt>, since the empty string indicates the
   root of tree.
</li></ul>
The grading programs will use <tt>locate()</tt> to check if your BST is balanced and
that the keys are stored correctly. So, make sure <tt>locate()</tt> is
correct. (This is not a difficult function to implement.)
</li></ol>

<p>
Your code must run without segmentation fault and without memory leaks.
For grading purposes, memory leaks are considered as bad as segmentation
faults. This is because many segmentation faults are cause by poorly
written destructors. A program with an empty destructor might avoid some
segmentation faults but will leak memory horribly. Thus, not
implementing a destructor or not deleting unused memory  must incur 
a penalty that is equivalent to a segmentation fault.

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2> 

<i>Here we list some recommendations and point out some traps and
pitfalls.</i>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
Remember that we are defining the height of a leaf node to be 0.
(The leaf node here is a node that contains actual data, not the null
pointers at the bottom of a BST.)
</p>

</li><li>
<p>
There are many places where the height and size of a node needs to be
updated including, for example, in the rebalance procedure.
</p>

</li><li> 
<p>
When you insert a key that is already in the binary search tree, you are
supposed to do nothing. (This is one of the standard alternatives.)
This means you have to be careful about how you update the sizes of the
subtrees, because when you insert a duplicate, the size does not change!
(and you won't find out that it is a duplicate until you've found its
'clone').
</p>

</li><li>
<p>
When should we check if we need to rebalance? One time to consider is
<i>after</i> we modify the Lazy BST in the <tt>insert()</tt> and
<tt>remove()</tt> procedures. However, we want to do the rebalancing as
high up the tree as possible. (See <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~chang/cs341.s17/projects/proj3.shtml#rebalance_note">note
above</a>.) So, checking for rebalancing after <tt>insert()</tt>
and <tt>remove()</tt> would require another traversal of the Lazy BST
from the root.
</p>
<p>
Instead, it is much more convenient to check for rebalancing
<i>before</i> we insert or remove an item (since we are traversing the
BST top down). This may seem counter-intuitive since <tt>insert()</tt>
and <tt>remove()</tt> will mess up our nicely balanced BST
right after we cleaned it up. However, even if we check for
rebalancing after these operations, the next <tt>insert()</tt>
or <tt>remove()</tt> will mess up the tree anyway.
</p>
<p>
Another temptation is to <tt>insert()</tt> or <tt>remove()</tt> the item 
during the <tt>rebalance()</tt> procedure. (Hey, we are taking this
subtree apart anyway, surely we can toss in or remove an item while
we are at it.) This is possible, but not elegant. Let's concentrate on
elegant uses of recursion in this project.
</p>

</li></ul>
